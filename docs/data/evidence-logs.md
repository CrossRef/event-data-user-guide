# Evidence Records

Evidence Logs trace the actions performed within Event Data during the creation of an Event. They should be read in conjunction with the Evidence Records. Evidence Logs are collected daily and are made up of a sequence of entries, each entry describing a particular action taken. Each Evidence Log corresponds to a slice of time, and typically comprises a few million entries.

There are a standard set of fields, including the Evidence Record ID. You can use this either to find all activity in the Evidence Log that corresponds to the processing of a particular Evidence Record, or to find the Evidence Record that corresponds to a particular Log Entry.

Evidence Logs and Evidence Records fulfill slightly different roles. The Evidence Record describes the data that came in, the resulting Events, and the interim steps that were taken, while the Evidence Logs describe in detail exactly which steps were taken.

Software changes over time, so it may not behave today the same way it behaved a year ago. The Evidence Records describe exactly what happened. Because of this you will see changes in the logs over time, including some log message types that are no longer produced.

# Format

Evidence Logs are available in two formats, which can be read by a wide variety of tools:

 - Lines of JSON entries
 - CSV

There is a controlled set of fields available. They have one-character names for compactness (log files can run to around one gigabyte per day). All fields except `t` are optional, and the precise meaning varies between log entry types:

| Field | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `t` | <u>T</u>imestamp | A UNIX epoch timestamp of when the action occurred, i.e. milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC. |
| `s` | <u>S</u>ervice | The service that logged the entry, in most cases the name of an Agent or the Percolator. For example, `reddit-agent` or `percolator`. |
| `c` | <u>C</u>omponent | The Component within the service, which broadly corresponds to a task being performed. For example, the Percolator has a `web` component to retrieve web pages. |
| `f` | <u>F</u>acet | The facet of work being done. For example, the Percolator's `web` component has a `request` facet for reporting on how it retrieves webpages, and a `robots-txt-check` to report on how it checks various websites' `robots.txt` files. |
| `i` | Log message type <u>I</u>D | An ID for the message type. Enables you to find a log type in the source code or to trace all log messages of the same type. |
| `p` | <u>P</u>artition | When the same task is running a number of times in parallel, a partition number might be indicated. |
| `r` | Evidence <u>R</u>ecord ID | This is included for all actions that are related to the processing of a given Evidence Record. |
| `a` | <u>A</u>ction ID | The Action ID, if present. Every Evidence Record is made up of Actions, most of which have IDs. This allows you to trace an input through to a match. Note that some Agents, for example Wikipedia, do not assign action IDs. |
| `v` | <u>V</u>alue | Some actions have a value associated with them. Depending on context this can be an input value or a result value. |
| `d` | <u>D</u>OI | The action may have an associated DOI. |
| `n` | Eve<u>n</u>t ID | The action may concern a particular Event. |
| `u` | <u>U</u>RL | The action may concern a particular URL. |
| `e` | R<u>e</u>sult status | Where an operation can succeed or fail, this can have a value of `t` for 'true', `f` for 'false', `e` for 'error' etc. |
| `o` | <u>O</u>rigin of the data | This can be `c` for 'cache' or `e`q for external. For example, `robots.txt` files are cached. This parameter allows you to know whether a value was retrieved at that point in time or from cache, which may explain why a value is slightly out of date.

Note that this list is not exhaustive, and historical log messages may use different fields. Specifically, during the pre-release Beta period, the format was changed on or around the 21st August 2017 for various components.

Note that the selection of fields may expand in future, including new fields names with more than one character. According to convention, the order of fields in the CSV file is specified by the first line, so you should not rely on the order of columns remaining unchanged.

# Log types

Every type of log message communicates a type of action or decision that was taken. You can identify them by the service.component.facet fields. In addition to this a message type ID is specified in the `i` field.

## Percolator

The Percolator is the system that performs the work of extracting and identifying links to registered content, and is used by all of the Crossref Agents. Therefore, when tracing the creation of an Event, most of the activity, and therefore log entries, will come from the Percolator. The Percolator works in batches, each batch being stored an Evidence Record. 

The Percolator works in three stages: identify candidates from the input data, match each candidate to a DOI, then produce an Event for each match. There are also underlying activities that happen (such as fetching webpages) that describe activity in more detail.

## Percolator DOI matching

 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "process"
 - `f` - "send-event"
 - `n` - The Event ID.
 - `r` - The Evidence Record ID.
 - `t` - Timestamp.

### Percolator failed to send Event

This arises when there is an error connecting to the internal event bus.

 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "process"
 - `f` - "send-event-error"
 - `n` - The Event ID


### Percolator input lag count

The Percolator monitors an input queue of Evidence Records sent by Agents. The Queue is split into a number of partitions, and each running instance of the Percolator monitors a number of partitions. At peak load the Percolator may get behind in processing, but catch up again at a quieter time. This log entry records how far behind the the Percolator is in each partition of the queue. 

This number can help to explain, for example, delays in the system between an event occurring and the time when it is processed.

 - `i` - "p000d"
 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "process"
 - `f` - "input-message-lag"
 - `p` - Partition number
 - `v` - Lag, measured in number of messages.
 - `t` - Timestamp.

### Percolator input lag time

 - `v` - Size, measured in bytes.
 - `r` - The Evidence Record ID.
 - `t` - Timestamp.

### Percolator starts processing Evidence Record

The Percolator records when it starts and finished processing each Evidence Record. You may occasionally see duplicate 'start' events for a given Evidence Record ID, due to the design of the pipeline. The Percolator ensures that it doesn't re-process the same Evidence Record twice. 

 - `i` - "p0010"
 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "process"
 - `f` - "start"
 - `r` - The Evidence Record ID.
 - `t` - Timestamp.

### Percolator skips already processed Evidence Record

 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "process"
 - `f` - "skip-already-processed"
 - `r` - The Evidence Record ID.

## Percolator lookups / matching

### Percolator validates DOI

When the Percolator needs to validate that a DOI exists, it will check a local cache of valid DOIs. If it can't find the DOI in the local cache, it will call out to the call out to the API on DOI.org. 

 - `i` - "p0015"

 - `r` - The Evidence Record ID.
 - `t` - Timestamp.

### Percolator resolves DOI on Handle API

This is called as part of `percolator.doi.validate`, and indicates that the Percolator went out and made a call to the DOI.org API via the Internet. Because it's sometimes difficult to identify precisely where a DOIs ends, the DOI validator may try validating the DOI by repeatedly dropping a number of characters from the end. 

 - `i` - "p0016"
 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "doi"
 - `f` - "resolve"
 - `v` - Input DOI
 - `e` - `t` if successful match, otherwise `f`.
 - `d` - Resulting DOI on success. Note that, as DOIs are case-insensitive, this value may be in a different case to the input.
 - `r` - The Evidence Record ID.
 - `t` - Timestamp.

### Percolator looks up PII with Crossref API

When the percolator finds a PII, it needs to make a call to the Crossref REST API to search for a DOI connected to that PII.

 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "fetch" 
 - `f` - "response"
 - `a` - The Action ID.
 - `u` - The URL requested (may be different due to redirects).

     - "timeout-exception" - There was a timeout waiting for the server to respond causing an error.
     - "timeout" - The Percolator killed an HTTP request as a failsafe because it took to long. Timeouts will usually be signalled by the other "timeout-exception" error type.
     - "protocol-exception" - There was a network-level error.
     - "unknown-exception" - Some other error.
 - `r` - The Evidence Record ID.
 - `t` - Timestamp.

### Percolator checked robots.txt file for URL

The Percolator checks the robots.txt file for every web request and only accesses a site if it is allowed. This log entry indicates whether or not a request for a URL was allowed by its `robots.txt` file. If you expect to find an Event but it it was not detected by in Event Data, you can check to see if the request was prevented by a robots.txt rule.

 - `i` - "p001b"
 - `s` - "percolator"

### Percolator skipped checking robots.txt file for URL

By default every request to a URL is whitelisted by a robots.txt file. However, under certain circumstances we are allowed to access a URL in contravention to the robots.txt rules. For example, the Wikipedia RESTBase API. This log entry indicates that a web request was made explicitly ignoring the robots.txt rules.

 - `i` - "p001c"
 - `s` - "percolator"
 - `c` - "robot-check"
 - `f` - "skip"
