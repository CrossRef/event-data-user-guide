## What it is

Authors of blog posts hosted on the Wordpress.com platform link to registered content items. The Wordpress.com Agent monitors the service to look for these links.

## What it does

 - Scans every article landing page domain in the `domain-list`, including `doi.org`
 - Makes a query to the Wordpress.com API for blog posts that mentioned that domain.
 - For each result, visits the blog post and attempts to extract links from the HTML of the blog post.

## Evidence Record

 - Includes batches of `landing-page-url` type observations.

## Edits / deletion

## Quirks

Note that this only monitors blogs hosted on Wordpress' wordpress.com platform. It does not monitor all blogs that use the Wordpress software.

## Failure modes

 - Publisher sites may block the Event Data Bot collecting landing pages.
