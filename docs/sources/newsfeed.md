## What it is

Links from blogs and other content with a newsfeed. 

## What it does

The Agent has a list of RSS feeds. It monitors each one for links to blog posts. If a blog post links to registered content, or mentions DOIs in the text, they are extracted into Events.

## Where data comes from

The `newsfeed-list` Artifact is consulted. On a regular basis the Agent retrieves the Artifact, then follows the link to every blog post or page mentioned. Data sources:

1. The `newsfeed-list` Artifact, curated by Crossref.
2. The content of each newsfeed. Each newsfeed may be operated by a different organization. 
3. The content of the individual blog posts.

Example RSS feeds include:

 - ScienceSeeker blog aggregator
 - ScienceBlogging blog aggregator

## Example Event

*Content to follow.*

## Methodology

On a regular basis (approximately every hour) the Newsfeed Agent starts a scan. Each scan:

1. It retrieves the most recent version of the `newsfeed-list` Artifact.
2. It scans over every RSS feed.
3. It passes the URL of every blog post to the Percolator.

## Evidence Record

 - Includes batches of `landing-page-url` type observations.

## Edits / deletion

 - Events may be edited if they are found to be faulty, e.g. non-existent DOIs

## Quirks

 - Links to blog posts are followed. If a summary of the blog post is included in the RSS feed, it is not consulted.

## Failure modes

 - RSS feeds may be taken offline.
 - RSS feeds may contain incomplete data.
 - RSS feeds may update too quickly for the Agent to keep up.
 - Publisher sites may block the Event Data Bot collecting landing pages.
 - Publisher sites may prevent the Event Data Bot collecting landing pages with robots.txt
 - Blog sites may block the Event Data Bot collecting landing pages.
 - Blog sites may prevent the Event Data Bot collecting landing pages with robots.txt
