# Appendix: Glossary

### Agent

A piece of software that gathers data for a particular data source and pushes it into Event Data. These can be operated by Crossref, DataCite or a third party.

### Altmetrics

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics): In scholarly and scientific publishing, altmetrics are non-traditional metrics proposed as an alternative to more traditional citation impact metrics, such as impact factor and h-index. Proposed as generalization of article level metrics.

### Landing page

The publisher's page for an item of registered content (for example, an article or a dataset etc). Every DOI resolves to a landing page, but there may be more than one landing page per content item. The URLs of landing pages can change over time, and the DOI link should always point to the panding page.

### Data source / data contributor

The provenance or type of Event Data. Data sources include Wikipedia, Crossref, DataCite etc. A Source is different to an Agent, which is a piece of software that fetches data for a particular data source.

### Event UUID

A UUID that corresponds to an Event within Crossref Event Data. 

### Registration Agency

An organization that assigns DOIs. For example, Crossref and DataCite.

### Registered content

Content that has been registered with Crossref and assigned a Crossref DOI, e.g an article or book chapter.

### UUID

Universally Unique Identifier. Essentially a random number that identifies an Event. Looks like `c0eb1c46-6a59-49c9-926b-a10667ddd9de`.

# Appendix: Abbreviations

### SICI

### TLA

Three letter abbreviation. 

### URL

Uniform Resource Locator. A path that points to a Research Object, e.g. `http://example.com`

## Deprecated terminology

The following words have been used during the development of Event Data but are no longer official:

 - Deposit - this is an internal entity used within Lagotto. It does not form part of the public Event Data service, although it may be of interest to users who want to look into the internals.
 - 'DOI Event Tracking' / 'DET' - the old name for the Crossref Event Data service.
 - Relations - this is an internal entity used within Lagotto. Event Data does not use Lagotto Relation objects. The concept of a 'relation' is present in the Event object as a description of how a subject and an object are related.
 - Publisher domains - now referred to as landing page domains
